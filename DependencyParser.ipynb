       "'The resurgent Antwerp Arms is now our pub of choice for match days. Saved from the developers when several local benefactors, including THFC themselves, stepped up to raise the final £125,000 needed before the deadline. This community owned pub is a one-room affair with a modern bare-boarded floor, and mainly furnished with banquette seating around the edges and normal tables and chairs elsewhere throughout. The pub has been extended at the back with the addition of a conservatory and this leads out to the small secluded courtyard garden outback which is pleasant when the sun is out and a boon on match days. Usually at least two beers available from the nearby Redemption brewery and it would be rude not to drink the Redeption Hotspur and it’s usually a well-kept pint. Although slightly out the way, despite being a short walk to the Tottenham High road, the Antwerp does benefits from a delightful setting overlooking Bruce Castle Park.'"
